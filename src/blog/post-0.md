## [Introduction to Astro](#introduction-to-astro)

Astro is a server-first JavaScript web framework for building content-driven websites. It's a static site generator that aims to reduce writing client-side JavaScript hence sites built with Astro are relatively faster than those built with many JavaScript frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js. One of its interesting features is that it is framework-agnosticâ€”meaning Astro is compatible with pretty much any JavaScript framework.

### [So, Why Astro?](#so-why-astro)

I stumbled on Astro about three weeks ago and after scanning the [website](https://astro.build), I decided to do the little blog tutorial in the docs. I realised that Astro had a familiar experience if you have some Vue.js or JSX knowledge. The docs are quite comprehensive and will give you expected results. I'm eyeing ðŸŒš Next.js docs as I write this by the way... The main attraction for me was the seamless built-in markdown support. I would build this blog with either Vue.js, Next.js or Nuxt.js anyway, but it would have taken me more time to decide to do so. But Astro felt welcoming so here we are!

## [My Process For Building My Personal Blog With Astro](#my-process-for-building-my-personal-blog-with-astro)

I ran `pnpm create astro@latest` and went with the minimal setup because I generally prefer to scaffold new projects on a clean slate.

```zsh showLineNumbers
pnpm install
pnpm astro add tailwind
pnpm add --save-dev --save-exact prettier prettier-plugin-astro
pnpm install -D prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

This is what my package.json file looks like at the time of writing this

```json showLineNumbers
"scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev",
    "build": "astro build",
    "postbuild": "pagefind --site dist",
    "preview": "astro preview",
    "astro": "astro",
    "prettier": "exec prettier . --write"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@astrojs/rss": "^4.0.11",
    "@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.1.7",
    "astro": "^5.8.0",
    "astro-icon": "^1.1.5",
    "astro-og-canvas": "^0.7.0",
    "astro-pagefind": "^1.8.3",
    "canvaskit-wasm": "^0.40.0",
    "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.1",
    "clsx": "^2.1.1",
    "mdast-util-to-string": "^4.0.0",
    "reading-time": "^1.5.0",
    "remark-toc": "^9.0.0",
    "slugify": "^1.6.6",
    "tailwind-merge": "^3.3.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^4.1.7"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@iconify-json/mdi": "^1.2.3",
    "@iconify-json/tabler": "^1.2.18",
    "pagefind": "^1.3.0",
    "prettier": "3.5.3",
    "prettier-plugin-astro": "0.14.1",
    "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss": "^0.6.11",
    "tw-animate-css": "^1.3.2"
  }
}
```

I had to add this `"prettier": "exec prettier . --write"` because I use Sublime Text and for some reason, prettier isn't formatting on save for this astro project specifically. I also didn't want to spend time trying to resolve it.
