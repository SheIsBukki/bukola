## [Introduction to Astro](#introduction-to-astro)

Astro is a server-first JavaScript web framework for building content-driven websites. It's a static site generator that aims to reduce writing client-side JavaScript hence sites built with Astro are relatively faster than those built with many JavaScript frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js. One of its interesting features is that it is framework-agnosticâ€”meaning Astro is compatible with pretty much any JavaScript framework.

### [So, Why Astro?](#so-why-astro)

I stumbled on Astro about three weeks ago and after scanning the [website](https://astro.build), I decided to do the little blog tutorial in the docs. I realised that Astro had a familiar experience if you have some Vue.js or JSX knowledge. The main attraction for me was the seamless built-in markdown support. I would build this blog with either Vue.js, Next.js or Nuxt.js anyway, but it would have taken me more time to decide to do so. But Astro felt welcoming so here we are!

The docs are quite comprehensive and will give you expected results. I'm eyeing ðŸŒš Next.js docs as I write this by the way...
