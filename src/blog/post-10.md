Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## A Comprehensive Guide to Setting Up a Vue Project

Vue.js is a flexible JavaScript framework that gives developers the freedom to build projects in different ways.

You can start writing Vue code or set up a Vue project using any of these methods:

In an HTML file with the content delivery network (CDN)
Through the Vue CLI (Webpack/Babel)
Scaffolding a Vue project with Vite

## Quick Start: Writing Vue Code in an HTML File

You can create an index.html file and add a CDN script to learn and get familiar with Vue syntax.

Create a folder in your pc
Create an index.html file
Open the file, add the HTML boilerplate, and an empty <script> tag that will contain your Vue code block.
Then add the following script:

<script src=“https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js”></script>

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
