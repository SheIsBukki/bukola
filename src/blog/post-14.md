If you have a folder of Markdown files with title and description fields in their frontmatter, use import.meta.glob() to load and pass these to the pages option of OGImageRoute.

In the following example, every Markdown file in the project’s src/pages/ directory is loaded and will have an image generated for them:

Less than a year ago, I was a novice in programming with no background in computer science which is why building this app was challenging but fulfilling. So, if you’re a beginner like me and everything seems overwhelming, I hope this motivates you to keep reading, practising, and building!

Prerequisites for building along:

Have at least a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Know how to use a code editor
Be familiar with the command line and terminal
Have Node.js installed on your machine — Vite, the build tool we will use to build this project, runs on Node.js
Know how to use a package manager like npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun
That said, if you are not a complete beginner with Vue.js, you can jump right into the section where we build the app.
